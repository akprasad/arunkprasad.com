In [yesterday's post][a-and-p] I quoted Toshiro Kageyama 7-dan, author of the
fantastic *Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go*. If I were more self-indulgent, I
would have quoted nearly half the book.

[a-and-p]: /log/amateurs-and-professionals/

But I just realized something: I have a *blog*, and I can do whatever I *want*!

In the quotes below, all emphasis is mine.


# On amateurs and professionals

On the beauty of the professional's work:

> Watching a professional game, one can sense beauty in the flow of play and
> beauty in the shapes created. Amateur go does not even begin to approach
> this.

The simple difference:

> To put it simply, amateurs play at the game; professionals labor at it.

Making the leap:

> [W]hat changed me from an amateur into a professional was getting a really
> firm grip on the fundamentals.

The universal rule:

> Faithfulness to fundamentals seems to be a common thread linking
> professionalism in all areas.

On trusting the basics:

> Go is the kind of game in which you are an expect if you can just keep on
> making ordinary moves. You need not play any especially brilliant moves at
> all. Amateurs' moves, however, are frequently far from ordinary; in fact, I
> see them making the most nonsensical moves imaginable[.]

Like your craft; be willing to learn; and put in the effort to do it right:

> No doubt the first requirement for becoming strong at go is to like it, like
> it more than food or drink, and a second requirement is the desire to learn.
> A third requirement is to study it, using proper methods, patiently, little
> by little, without cramming. Ask dan-level amateurs and you will find that
> they did not become stronger just by playing their opponents for fun. Each one
> kindled the desire to learn more, and put in no small amount of time
> studying.


# On fundamentals:

Internalizing the fundamentals:

> The most important thing to learn from professionals is not where they play
> but why they play there.

Fundamentals are endless:

> When he advances to the point where he begins to think of himself as a strong
> player, the thing he needs to do to become ever stronger is to go back and
> study the fundamentals once more.

On making them instinctual:

> [...] the game lasts for two or three hundred moves, and you cannot stop at
> each one to consider each of the fundamentals. You have to soak up the
> fundamentals as you practice on your own, studying them until they become a
> part of your very being. *If the fundamentals do not operate subconciously
> when you sit down to play, you have not mastered them yet.*


# On the dangers of amateurism

Collapsing due to shallow, brittle knowledge:

> [Those who memorize fixed opening patterns] tend to become too depending on
> patterns, thereby crippling their innate strength, and fall easy prey to the
> formal, who have nothing but innate strength to rely on.

On the disastrous end of the amateur path. My favorite quote from the book:

> *The reason that so many people never master this elementary skill is that
> they keep ignoring it as being beneath them.* They are the people who cannot
> be bothered to 'read'; who try to capture the uncapturable group because it
> just looks as if it can be done or because they figure they can muddle
> through somehow, and so they rush headlong into disaster. They are also the
> people who, when they face a slightly stronger opponent, do not try to
> capture the capturable group because with their fuzzy reading they are afraid
> of messing it up; who innocently add unnecessary stones to their already
> alive groups; who take fright without cause; who tremble when they sit down
> at the go board; who play through the whole game without a sullen expression;
> who lose every fight; who eventually come to hate go. *Sorry wretches,
> through choice they have abandoned the most interesting and enjoyable of all
> games.*


# On emotional management

Avoiding despair:

> Anyone who leads an abandoned and dissipated life because the end of the wold
> is near is going to experience his own personal destruction first.
> Desperation and despair are to be feared most of all.


# On effort

Effort in everything:

> There is a saying that a lion gives its all when chasing even a rabbit.

The pain of effort is worth it -- but only if done right:

> Of course one cannot make progress in any discipline without effort. 'There
> is no pleasure without pain.' Pleasure is progress, and pain the pain of
> effort.  Study in the wrong way, however, and the result may be just pain
> with no pleasure at all. One must, without fail, learn the correct way to
> study.

The reward:

> No professional regrets the time he has to spend studying. [...] The way
> young players have taken over the game can only be called terrifying. The
> time they spend studying every day defies the imagination.

Talent is not enough:
>
> Professionals do this unquestioningly. Even a gemstone has to be polished.
> 'A man is always moving either forward or backward,' says Kano, 9-dan. 'He
> never stands still. This should be every go player's motto, and he should
> *keep piling effort on top of effort* no matter what his age. He can be
> confident of always making progress.'
